/**
 * Gatekeeper wrapper for routes that require an authenticated + unlocked session.
 *
 * Decision table:
 *   | authed | encryptionKey | action                    |
 *   | false  |    (any)      | → /login (no session)     |
 *   | true   |    null       | → /unlock (session alive, |
 *   |        |               |   but key not in memory)  |
 *   | true   |    present    | render children           |
 *
 * Why two separate redirects (not one "login or unlock" path):
 *   The UX is different. /login asks for email + password and issues a
 *   new JWT + refresh pair. /unlock asks for password only and reuses
 *   the existing refresh cookie — no network auth round-trip, faster UX,
 *   and doesn't revoke their other active sessions.
 *
 * `replace` on Navigate: replaces the current history entry instead of
 * pushing a new one, so the back button doesn't bounce users between
 * /vault and /login during an auth failure loop.

/**
 * Route table.
 *
 * Why the `<AppContent>` indirection:
 *   `useAuth` must be called under `<AuthProvider>`. Putting <Routes>
 *   directly at the top level would risk ProtectedRoute trying to read
 *   the context before the provider mounts. The wrapper keeps tree depth
 *   explicit: ErrorBoundary > ToastProvider > AuthProvider > BrowserRouter
 *   > AppContent > Routes.
 *
 * Unknown-path fallback: `<Route path="*">` sends any unmatched URL to
 * /login rather than a 404 page — the app only has four routes so a stray
 * URL is almost certainly a user who needs to sign in.
