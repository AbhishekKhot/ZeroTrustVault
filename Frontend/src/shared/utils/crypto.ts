 *      compromise (XSS) cannot exfiltrate the key material; it can only

 *   4. Return { encryptionKey, authHash } to the caller. The caller
 *      sends authHash to the server for login; keeps encryptionKey in
 *      React state only (never localStorage, never cookies).
 *
 * Why we terminate the worker in `finally`:
 *   One-shot derivation: we spawn the worker per call. Leaving it alive
 *   would hold its heap (including the password string) around until GC.
 *   Terminating tells the browser to free the thread immediately.

 *   pair is ever reused — reuse leaks the XOR of the plaintexts to an
 *   attacker who has both ciphertexts. So we `getRandomValues(12)`
 *   every single call, giving us a new IV. 12 bytes is the NIST-
 *   recommended size for GCM (shorter gets padded; longer loses
 *   efficiency).
 *
 * Why we stringify the data:
 *   AES operates on byte strings. JSON is our canonical serialisation
 *   so {website, username, password} survives the round trip.
 *
 * Output shape:
 *   { iv: hex(12 bytes), encrypted_data: hex(ciphertext + 16-byte auth tag) }.
 *   The auth tag is the "G" in GCM — it detects tampering. Any modification
 *   to the ciphertext causes decryptData to throw.
