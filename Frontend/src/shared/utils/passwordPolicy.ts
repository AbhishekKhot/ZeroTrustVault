 * catch the top offenders locally so users at minimum aren't registering

/**
 * Validate a proposed master password.
 *
 * Use case:
 *   Called in Register.tsx before we run PBKDF2. Returns `null` on success
 *   or a user-facing error string on failure (rendered into the form).
 *
 * Why this enforcement is CLIENT-only:
 *   The server never sees the plaintext password — by design — so it
 *   cannot check policy. Any client can bypass this by posting straight
 *   to /auth/register with a weak password, but that client would then
 *   be harming *themselves* (weak key → weak vault). We're not protecting
 *   the server; we're protecting the honest user from their own bad habit.
 *
 * Rules (chosen to be pragmatic, not maximal):
 *   - ≥ 12 chars: NIST SP 800-63B's floor for human-memorised passphrases.
 *   - Must contain at least one letter AND one digit: keeps people from
 *     using pure numeric PINs or pure ASCII words.
 *   - Not in the common-password list (checked case-insensitively).
 *
 * We intentionally do NOT require special characters or mixed case.
 * NIST withdrew those rules because they push users toward predictable
 * substitutions ("Password1!") without adding real entropy.
