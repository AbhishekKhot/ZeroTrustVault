 * Auth context provider.
 *
 * ── Design pattern: Provider / Context ────────────────────────────────────
 * Holds "am I logged in?" and "do I have the AES key in memory?" for the
 * whole app. Consumed by ProtectedRoute and every page that needs the
 * encryption key.
 *
 * The two-flag model (see [useAuth.ts](./useAuth.ts) for the context shape):
 *   - `authed` — does the server still consider this browser session valid?
 *   - `encryptionKey` — is the derived key loaded into React state?
 *
 *   Both can be true (happy path: user just logged in).
 *   `authed && !encryptionKey` means the session is alive but the key was
 *   cleared — e.g. 5-min auto-lock, or the user reloaded the page (React
 *   state is lost, but the httpOnly refresh cookie survives). We route
 *   those to /unlock instead of /login so they don't pay the full login cost.
 *   `!authed` means no valid session → /login.
